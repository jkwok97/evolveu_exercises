// CODING CHALLENGE #1

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs
// 3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// 4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). 
// GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€


var massJohn, massMark, heightJohn, heightMark, bmiJohn, bmiMark;

massJohn = 78;
massMark = 60;
heightJohn = 3.6;
heightMark = 2.9;

bmiJohn = massJohn / heightJohn^2;
bmiMark = massMark / heightMark^2;

// var compare = bmiMark > bmiJohn;
// console.log("Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? " + compare)

if (bmiMark > bmiJohn) {
    console.log("Mark's BMI is higher than John's")
} else {
    console.log("John's BMI is higher than Mark's")
